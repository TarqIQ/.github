# TarqIQ

Open-source tools at the intersection of biomedical knowledge graphs, chemical reaction extraction, and AI-driven reasoning.

## Repositories
- **[BioMed-KAI](https://github.com/TarqIQ/BioMed-KAI)** — Knowledge-augmented intelligence framework for biomedical reasoning and graph-enhanced LLM workflows.  
- **[RxNExtract](https://github.com/TarqIQ/RxNExtract)** — LLM-based extraction of chemical reaction procedures into structured reaction data.  
- **[MedKG](https://github.com/TarqIQ/MedKG)** — Biomedical knowledge graph integrating multi-omics, drug, disease, and pathway associations.  
- **[ChemInstruct](https://github.com/TarqIQ/ChemInstruct)** — Toolkit for chemical NER model training, evaluation, and benchmarking.

## Mission
To build lightweight, extensible frameworks that unify knowledge graphs, machine learning, and chemical/biomedical data for accelerated discovery.
